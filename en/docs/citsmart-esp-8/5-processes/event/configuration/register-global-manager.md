title: Register Global manager
Description: 
#Register Global manager

This functionality is intended to create rules to monitor several types of
events.

Each global event manager contains an EPL for Information, Warning, and/or
Exception. EPL is an event correlation language used by Esper (Espertech). In
the initialization of CITSmart Event Monitor, these EPLs are imported into the
Esper engine so that a new correlated event will be created each time the
condition set in the EPL is satisfied. Example of an EPL that correlates between
CITSmart Inventory and Nagios events: \@Description ('For any Nagios event that
occurs after any Inventory event in the last 10 minutes) select \* from pattern
[every a = EventCheckInventory- \> b = EventServiceNagios where timer: within
(10minutes)].

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and
deleting a global manager.
