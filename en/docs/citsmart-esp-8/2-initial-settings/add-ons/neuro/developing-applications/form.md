The configured folder does not interfere with system operation.

  3- Page Setup: refers to the type of page that will be created using the form. There are 3 types in Neuro:  
    - Default page: search the data inside database and register directly on it. Works great for screens that have CRUD function. Generates the Default Page tab.  
    - Process page: Workflow/ESI Design need business process. This is the first page that will be used when executing a flow. Generates the Page for task.  
    - Page for task: Page for human tasks that are run through a created Workflow/ESI Design. Generates the tab Page for task.  
    - Report page: page for reports generated by the application. Generates the tab Page for task.  
    - ITSM process page: Page for ITSM system processes associated with business processes.  
    - ITSM Task Page: a human task page that runs through a workflow created for ITSM. Generates the tab Page for task.  
  4- The generated tabs will have the following structure:  
    - HTML: page html structure;  
    - HTML mobile: html framework for mobile devices;  
    - Controller: controller code referring to the form;  
    - Dependencies: The dependencies of the application are reported. The name of the dependency and the path in which it is located must be entered. The user must also inform whether it will be injected into the controller.
