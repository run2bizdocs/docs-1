# Frequently Asked Questions

??? Question "How are documents ranked at the time of SOLR knowledge base search?"
    To rank the documents at the time of the search, Solr generates a score for each document.
    Thus, the document that has the highest score, is presented first and the others, with lower scores, in sequence.
    To calculate the document score Solr uses a standard algorithm, where the frequency of the searched term is checked. But, it is possible to change the punctuation with the use of the boosts.
    
	Solr's boosters can be used in two moments at the time of indexing or query, and their use in search is more common.
    Some boosters that may change the calculation of the score at the time of the survey are:
    
    - term^num: where "num" is the importance of the search term, example: incident^2;
    - And the field boosters and dismax and edismax functions can also be used to boost search.
    
	At ITSM, no booster is used, so far, only Solr's standard score calculation is used, and at the end of the search the ranking is done by the score and by the number of times the knowledge was voted / liked.
    
    Boosters are open for use, but to use them requires a better analysis of the importance of fields and documents added to Solr, by the knowledge base.
    
??? Question "How can Event Management become a business monitoring tool?"
    WEBSERVICE SCHEME FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS (BUSINESS MONITORING)
    You can connect the EVM component to any software, even one other than the one the Event Management module normally integrates (Nagios, Zabbix and Inventory) as long as the data sent via webservice follows a pre-set standard.
    
    Once the data is sent to the CITSmart Event Monitor, rules can be created (for example, with the Esper EPL) so that certain events are triggered according to some condition observed in the data.
    
    Example "Payroll":
    
    - Let's say it's the rule that one company does not hire more than 5 employees per industry.
    - The payroll program could send the minimum data of each hiring by department (defined in the company's budget plan), so that whenever the contraction number per department exceeds the pre-established limit, an event of "excess hiring "Could be fired.

??? Question "What is the impact of the "Solver Group" filter on the behavior of Inquiries and Incidents searches?"
    When the "solver group" filter is active, only closed ones will be shown, since when selecting this filter, it is understood that there is a need to present the group that actually solved a request, not presenting groups responsible for tasks (according to The flow bound to the request service) executed after the request is resolved.
    
	Let's look at a generic example:
    - For example, service A has a linked quality flow, after solving a service A request and advancing the flow, the responsible group will be the quality group and this will terminate the life cycle of the request in question, but this group is not The group that solved this request, it only approved the solution and terminated the request, so it will not appear in the report generated by the Inquiries and Incidents search screen when the "Solver Group" filter is marked with a specific group.
    - However, when the "Solver Group" filter is not active, the group presented in the report or search will be the group referring to the current request task, ie if the request is closed and has a quality flow, the group will be presented Of quality as the current group responsible for closing the life cycle of this request, if the request is in progress, will be presented the current group responsible for the execution of this request.
    
??? Question "What is the meaning of each inventory status of CIs?"
    - Inventory - the inventory was able to read the CI information and ended successfully
    - Ignored - In the citsmart / pages / evmInventoryConfiguracao / evmInventoryConfiguracao.load screen we have an option to ignore the machines being inventoried, this markup appears when this occurs,
    - Unreachable - When the server encounters the IC but can not bring the information,
    - Not inventoried - When neither it finds the IC in the network, but knows that it already existed,
    - Running - While reading the inventory, the IC is in this status.
    
??? Question "What is the meaning of each privacy a knowledge can have in the knowledge base?"
    - Public: all users with access to the Knowledge Portal have access, regardless of whether they have access to the knowledge folder.
    - Confidential: only author and approver can view knowledge.
    - Internal: only people with permission in the knowledge folder can view.
    
??? Question "What is the type of permission for the Logdados table backup folder?"
    The folder permissions must be to read and write for the JBoss user.
    
??? Question "When does data synchronization occur with LDAP?"
    The system synchronizes the credential data of its users with LDAP in three different situations:
    
	1. On application activation, usually in sequence to the product version update procedure;
    2. When the user logs in (access to the system with its login and password), then the system automatically checks the user's authentication and permission;
    3. In the LDAP Configuration menu option, when the user clicks its 'Synchronize' link.
    
??? Question "When is removed the data from the Logdata table?"
    The backup routine of the LogData table removes the data from the table and saves it to a file, that is, the table becomes clean after processing.
    
??? Question "When is the Logdata table Information deleted?"
    The LogData tab daily backup routine clear the tab's data and saves as a file, that is, the tab is cleared after the processing.
    
??? Question "Why are the schedules created by the tool different from the current time?"
    SCENARIO
    1. When creating a ticket, the time is different from the actual time, alternating between 1 (one) and 3 (three) hours of delay or advance.

	WHAT TO CHECK
    1. Postgresql database configuration file:
    Postgresql.conf
    timezone = 'BRAZIL/EAST'
    2. On the container cloud:
    Setting timezone on the operating system.
    3.Setting up the TimeZone on the JRE:
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/troubleshoot/time-zone-settings-jre.htm#JSTGD362
    
??? Question "Why in some reports does the same request appear more than once?"
    In some reports such as "Report Incidents / Service Requests - Detailed", both in pdf format and in xls format, the same request may exist more than once, however they are distinct details because it deals with each step of the request, so each time it "repeats" is because it changes the task, or the responsible, or the phase, or the situation, or the group solver or the final hour of service.
    
    In other reports, such as the "Report Incidents / Service Requests", there is no detail of the request according to the activities and therefore the request is not shown more than once.
    
??? Question "Why is the result 'Empty Report' when generating the reportQuantitativeControlPercentual when selecting in the filter the situation 'in progress' and the 'solver group'?"
    This is not an error, the solver group field is populated only when the request is terminated, this causes to only brings results to situations such as "Closed", incompatible with what is being requested / reported in the filters.
    
??? Question "Why will service request numbering not always follow a strict / perfect sequential order on the service request screen or in some reports?"
    Both the Service Request screen and some reports (such as "Quality of Service - SLA"), the ordering of the number of requests follows an increasing sequential order, except when:
    
    1. The reports group the data by some special criteria (eg, by SLA, which is what happens in the case of the report "Quality of Service - SLA")
    2. When the feature called Sequence Block is impacted by an external factor, this occurs if:
    - There is an application stop for version upgrade, or environment maintenance and later return.
    - The environment is clustered.
    
??? Question "Will the backup be overwritten or will there be a file for every day?"
    If your routine has a daily backup, a file will be created every day, containing the name and date of the file.
