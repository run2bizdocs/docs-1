!!! info "What’s Markdown?"
    Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

## Basic Syntax

### Headers
Structure your comments using headers. Headers segment longer comments, making them easier to read.

Start a line with a hash character # to set a heading. Organize your remarks with subheadings by starting a line with additional hash characters, for example ####. Up to six levels of headings are supported.

Example:

```sh
# This is a H1 header
## This is a H2 header
### This is a H3 header
```

Result:

# This is a H1 header
## This is a H2 header
### This is a H3 header
