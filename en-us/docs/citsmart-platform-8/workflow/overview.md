Title: Overview

# Overview

## Presentation

Workflows are visual representations of something that moves continuously. The Workflow feature is intended to model your business objectives, describing the steps that need to be taken to achieve those goals through a smart digital workflow. It is possible to create workflows to aid in the management of services, problems, changes, releases, continuity actions, travel and purchases requests. Moreover, the workflow interacts with the main CITSmart processes.

## Functionalities

**Standard:**

- [Workflow Design][1]
