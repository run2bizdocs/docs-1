!!! info ""
    In version 8.0.2.0, the parameter 299 - Ticket - Enable message exchange has been retired because the messaging functionality has been replaced by the Chat. The histories are kept in the occurrence histories.

!!! info ""
    In version 8.0.2.0 in the ticket list we insert the possibility of appearing the field "Description". In order to view this field, the user must follow the procedures:

    1.	Clean cookies;

    2.	Delete records from serviceRequestColumnsProfile table
    
    3.	Restart the system after developing step 2.

    Chat communication in this version is most effective when done in the same browser, if a requester and an attendant are in different browsers, there may be a long delay in message exchange.

    For a better experience of the CITSmart version 8.0.2.0, we advise that the “my requests” and “my approvals” widgets to be replaced by the “my tickets” widget in the customers Experience Centers.

*Known error and solution*

Note the following scenario:

-   Preconditions:

    1.  The client will be upgrading from version 7 to version 8.0.0.5;

    2.  The consultant did not parametrize in the Problem Portfolio the folder
        to save the Known Error knowledge base;

-   What happens:

    1.  The user accesses the Problem Management screen;

    2.  The user informs the Root Cause field and attempts to save the knowledge base;

    3.  When open the Knowledge Base screen for saving, the system presents the message
        that the user does not have the permission;

-   Why does it happen?

    1.  The message appears because the consultant did not informed the folder to save
        the known error in the Problem Portfolio;

    2.  Once you try to save the known error, the system does not identify the folder
        and sends the message;

    3.  In these cases, contact the Citsmart Support to make the correctness of this
        register;

    4.  Make the configuration of the known error saving folder on the Problem Portfolio
        screen;

    5.  In the next registration the message will not be repeated.
