*Known error and solution*

Note the following scenario:

-   Preconditions:

    1.  The client will be upgrading from version 7 to version 8.0.0.5;

    2.  The consultant did not parametrize in the Problem Portfolio the folder
        to save the Known Error knowledge base;

-   What happens:

    1.  The user accesses the Problem Management screen;

    2.  The user informs the Root Cause field and attempts to save the knowledge base;

    3.  When open the Knowledge Base screen for saving, the system presents the message
        that the user does not have the permission;

-   Why does it happen?

    1.  The message appears because the consultant did not informed the folder to save
        the known error in the Problem Portfolio;

    2.  Once you try to save the known error, the system does not identify the folder
        and sends the message;

    3.  In these cases, contact the Citsmart Support to make the correctness of this
        register;

    4.  Make the configuration of the known error saving folder on the Problem Portfolio
        screen;

    5.  In the next registration the message will not be repeated.

|Type|Functionality|Description|

|Fixe|Ticket Management|The Sub-Request and Related Request functionalities were restructured to provide greater compliance to their assignments. The focus of this fix was to bring the functionalities closer to their proposal. For further information, see [Relate Ticket][1] and [Register Sub-Request][2]|
|Fixe|Webservices|The synchronization for creating new Activities has changed in the business rule, that's because it's not possible to create an activity that doesn't have a link with the Business Service and Portfolio. Therefore, the webservice designated for creation will open a ticket with the parameters in the initial configuration of the service.
