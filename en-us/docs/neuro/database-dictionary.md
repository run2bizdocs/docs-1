# Neuro Data Dictionary

As we can see on the Wikipedia site, a data dictionary is a collection of metadata that contains definitions and representations of data elements. Within the context of DBMS, a data dictionary is a group of tables enabled only for reading or querying, ie it is a database itself which, among other things, holds information such as:

- Precise definition of data elements
- User Profiles, Roles and Privileges
- Description of objects
- Integrity Restrictions
- Among others
