Before getting started
--------------------------

1.  Have configured the application in the ITSM instance;

2.  Install the CITSmart FS application in the mobile (Android and iOS);

    be possible to field attendance in offline.

Procedure
-------------

!!! Abstract "NOTE"

    When logging into the CITSmart FS application, the first synchronization can take 
    a few moments, because to work offline, you have to download all the requests and 
    send the ones that have changed, so that the application works correctly.

1.  Enter the login data of the application;

2.  Select and click on the ticket you want. It'll be presented a screen with
    the request data, including the location map where it'll make the
    attendance;

3.  Click on "Execute request" and then on "Other data" (this option will
    be only available if exists a questionnaire linked to the ticket activity).
    Complete the data about the request execution and  click on "Save";
    
    !!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
        Only simple components of Neuro, for example, forms, can be rendered in the Mobile FS.
        These forms cannot have any JavaScript logic linked to them, they should be similar to 
        the existing questionnaire in CITSmart SM.
        
    !!! Abstract "RULE"
    
        It's not possible to link a CI and a knowledge base through the FS mobile.
    
4.  If you want to add some file, click on the tab "Attachments";

5.  Click on "Notes" and report the occurrence referring to the ticket and the date that it happened. It's also possible to save the         time taken to solve the problem. It's available the visualization of this report by the requester and the sending of the same to         his/her email by selecting the options "Visible to the requester" and "Send to e-mail".

    the operation. It'll be automatically synchronized the changes. If the
    application does not find network to complete the synchronization, it'll be

    synchronization;

8.  Manual synchronization of requests is available as soon as the application
    finds an accessible network. To do so, simply slide the screen down with
    your finger or click on the icon "Update list";

    through the search box, or click on the icon "Filters".
