Before getting started
----------------

It's necessary to first have a functional e-mail service (SMTP), since the sending of the password is done via e-mail.

Procedure
------------

*1st Step: Create an email template for changing the password*

1.  Access the main menu System \> Settings \> Email Template;

2.  Create an email template to change the password;

    !!! warning "NOTE"

        In order for the user to receive the new access information, it's necessary to use,
        in the e-mail message, the key ‘${NOVASENHA}’ (for example, the key about the "New
        password”). In addition, you can also send the user login using the key ‘${LOGIN}’
        (for example, the key about the“Login”).  

*2nd Step: Set the parameter about the service to change the password*

1.  Access the main menu Parametrization \> CITSmart Parameters;

2.  Edit and save parameter 116 by assigning the numeric value of the ID generated
    for the newly created e-mail template;

What to do next
------------------

To test the service to change the password, access the login page, click on "Forgot your password?", enter a local user login and click on "Save".
