        The parameters 65 (that identifies the default call origin ID of the
        service request) and 105 (identifies the source ID that will default 
        when creating a new incident) automatically set up a contact source 
        when the user registers a ticket. Therefore, if the field "Contact
        origin", in the ticket screen, is *not* mandatory, but, if there's an 
        indication in the previously parameters, the field will be completed
        automatically.
