#Create ticket
Create a ticket means opening a call within the system, with possibility to monitor its attendance history with view of all actions sent to it.

Before getting started
--------------------------

Some items in a ticket's registration depend on the information registered in
CITSmart ITSM, for example an employee, group, contract, unit, time of
attendance, portfolio with activities and services, as well as links between
some configured parameters. Set the parameters 9, 40, 41, 260 and 343.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Processes \> Request and
    Incident Management \> Service Request and Incident;

2.  Click on the options button “Operations” and then on "Register";

3.  Give the data necessary;

4.  Complete all necessary data.

!!! Abstract "TIP"

    The "Description" field is the space for the ticket information to contain 
    words that refer directly to that service, being objective and easily associated 
    with the request theme. This content is linked to the "Keyword" field and to its 
    search return, which exists within the advanced search mode of a ticket.

What to do next
-------------------

View in the ticket pane listed and check the information registered.
