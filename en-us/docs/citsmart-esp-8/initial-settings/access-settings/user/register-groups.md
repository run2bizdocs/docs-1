#Register group
A group is a set of one or more employees with the same related objectives and its functions.
The two most common usages for the groups created are:

1.	Automatic notification scheduling based on some specific event/situation;

2.	Security/secrecy management of access to various types of registries (e.g.: knowledge base folders, service portfolios, etc.).
