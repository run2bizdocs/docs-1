*4th Step: Include required information in the CITSmart configured on Okta:*

1. You will need to configure some data in the WildFly directory. Access the directory, open the "/standalone/configuration" folder and change the file "citsmart.cfg".

    ![Wildfly Directory](images/okta.img11.png)

2. Accessed the file, you need to include this information in the file "citsmart.cfg":
       
   a) In the line *SAML2_HOST* and *SAML2_PORT* include the address and port of the CITSmart application;
       
   b) In the line *SAML2_METADATA* include the SAML metadata of the Okta. This data can be obtained by following the instructions below:
 
      - Access the CITSmart application in Okta, click the "Applications > Applications" tab and then on "Sign On". When you click on the "Identity Provider metadata" option, a new tab will be available to the metadata, copy the URL of the browser and insert in the property *SAML2_METADATA*;
        
    ![Sign On](images/okta.img12.png)

   c) In the line *OKTA_URL*, include the main URL in the Okta account.
   
   d) In the line *OKTA_TOKEN*, include the token to access through API. To get this token, follow these steps:
   
3. Access the CITSmart application in Okta, select the "Security > API" menu and then click on "Create Token". Name the token and click on "Create Token". It will be presented the token value to be copied on the line quoted above.
   
    ![Token](images/okta.img13.png)

   e) In the line *OKTA_DOMAIN_ALIAS*, include the domain of users coming from Okta.
  
*5th Step: Synchronize Okta user on CITSmart:*

1. Within CITSmart, access the "Okta Config" menu and register a new configuration by clicking on "New";

    ![Okta Confg](images/okta.img14.png)

2. Complete the fields with the necessary information:

    ![Fields Okta Confg](images/okta.img15.png)

    * **Description**: introduce a definition of this new setting Okta;
     
    * **Alias**: include the user domain that will be saved to the database. Example: okta\administrador@citsmart.com;
     
    * **URL domain**: should include the same value (URL) that was entered in the line *OKTA_URL* in the "citsmart.cfg" file; 
     
    * **Token API**: include the same value of the token inserted in the line *OKTA_TOKEN* in the file "citsmart.cfg";
     
    * **Group**: insert the ID of the group in which the synchronized and registered user will belong in CITSmart;
     
    * **Access Profile**: insert the profile ID in which the synchronized and registered user will belong in CITSmart;
     
    * **Application ID**: include the application ID. This information can be retrieved from the Okta URL, as shown below:
     
    ![URL ID](images/okta.img16.png)

3. Click on "Save" and then on "Synchronize users" to perform the operation.

*6th Step: Configure the Logout:*

1. Since Okta does not have a logout screen, in parameter 377 of CITSmart, we can insert some page address to redirect the user to the end of the session;

2. Set up the logout link also at the address **(Admin > Settings > Customization > Sign-Out-Page)**, then check the option "Use the custom sign-out page". Therefore, enter the URL (https://localhost:8443/citsmart/saml/logout) with the appropriate adaptations (host and port), according to the image below:

![Logout](images/okta.img19.png)

!!!Abstract "NOTE"
   
    When *logout* in CITSmart, do not *logout* from the Okta, since users may have other applications in the Okta session. In       contrast, if you do Okta *logout*, the user session in CITSmart will be removed.

What to do next
----------------------

Once the Okta integration with CITSmart is complete, some CITSmart parameters can be configured to better customize this integration. They are:

 
 - The parameter 445 (Name of the Administrator group in Okta) allows you to choose the administrator group in the Okta solution. If the user belongs to this chosen group, he/she will have the access profile defined as administrator. If this is not the case, your access profile will be the default profile defined by the parameter 39.
